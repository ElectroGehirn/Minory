Hi, its me ElectroGehirn, the founder of this project, and EoGn. This is a first step to show what is happening right now with the project because the idea has been around since 2022 and was also started in 2022.
And it's been a long time. Since I am working on this alone, it can all take a while to be something workable, but I do my best, but I am new to Java and do my best to understand the language.
Later on, with much luck, I get a job, and then I have time for this project and MUCH more motivation. I am also going to pay a programmer that does the really hard things for me, like our unique login system that is planned.
I am now working on all of the things that you can see and some you cannot see, like the calculations that the program does to do a task. What I need to point out is that this project is not a "project," like you know.
This is a project that will not find its end; it will be continued forever. If I don't have time, I pay a programmer. I want to build a team for the future that does all of this if I don't have the time anymore (what I don't think so).
Or any other disruptive thing that could happen

Our plans are still on our site, and we will go deep into them when we reach a point where it's not that easy to copy our plans, because if you have good ideas, they are yours and nobody else, and you took the time and effort to get them.
So to understand why this is not much about, that's why.

The builds I will release here are what is new right now because, like I said, it's been a long development time, and I should do the first step to show what is going on, and I hope we will manage the first alpha release that is for chat testing.
We will then do a 2-month-long announcement so that everyone can be ready, and the best would be a first 24/7 running chat!

So we have big plans, but the way we make them a reality is a huge step, and it would be helpful for your support and help! It's not only depending on me or others later on in the project or just you; it depends on both sides, so let us do something in the future.

BTW, we are obfuscating the code for reasons of copiers and security, and also because it's only me that is seeing this mess of a code (it's not really a mess, but it's from a starter).

For questions or something, you can just reach out to the issues tab and just ask

Maybe I should note this: I am a pro at procrastinating, so I am sometimes working on it a little, then months not, and often then I come back and do lots of things a long time, like right now.
