Login window is resizeable (was left in from developing a rewrite of the login screen)

Window Size bugs, the welcome image and the login screen image is outside the bounds of the JFrame (fixed in later versions they are intended for releases)

A very dumb write issue in the first welcome screen (fixed soon)

Server connection is spammable (needs a client side prevention, and a server side prevention)

Textfield in minorysite1 is duplicated if you spam the site icon (Fix will be later on)

Minorysite1 doesnt turn off if you switch to the home site (Fix will be later on)

All other bugs please in the Issues tab
